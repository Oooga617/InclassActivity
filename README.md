What I ended up doing in class:

So I attempted to program in Standard PBR shader, Transparency, Enhanced Hologram, Texture blending, Decal and Front Stencil shader in class. The PBR shader I initially had difficulties because for some reason the specular effect wouldn't appear, and I had to check over the example code, and copy and paste portions of it to get mine working which eventually worked. I tried to see if I can make an ice effect, by blending in an ice texture I got online with the metal to make an effect of metal in the process of becoming frozen. What I would do differently with this though is problably be less reliant in copying and pasting code, and try to do more of typing down and put my own comments to further my understanding. I did not get the transparency shader to work at all, and I tried to use this image of a tree with a black background with it, but after constantly looking over with the code and having someone look over my shader the image appearing on the plane and quad would just be black when I try using the tree image. I have no idea on what I can do better with this, and I couldnt figure out for the life of me on how to fix this. The hologram I had an easier time working with, but I did had to fix some errors that appeared in the console while I looked over the code for reference. I messed with the shader a bit with seeing what I can change in terms of the color and line effect, but I didn't accomplish much. The texture blending also went well, and after ironing out a few errors I managed to use a fog texture image to be applied to make a fog effect for one of the capsules. With that said I did try to use the same tree image to see if this will work with that shader, which it does display the tree but its transparent instead of only removing the black background. For the decal texture I also had little to no issues with after fixing up my typed down code, as I tried to stray further and further away with copying and pasting everything. I got to use a bullet hole texture and got it to appear over the object to make it look damaged which is nice. Finally, the Front Stencil shader was not a success at all, and I dont get why as the code is little compared to the other shaders, and I used a quad. The quad only becomes invisible but it doesnt cut through the wall I have set up like its supposed to. This is another case where I don't know what else could I have done to fix it, except asking for help.
